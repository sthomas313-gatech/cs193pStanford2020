# cs193pStanford2020
The lectures for the Spring 2020 version of Stanford University's course CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI) were delivered to our students in an on-line fashion due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.  Special thanks to Stanford University and Professor Paul Hegarty 

This was my first time learning and creating applications using Swift.
